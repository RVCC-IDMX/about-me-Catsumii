## Description
This was an All About Me website to reflect off of the topics from the Web Page class I was taking at RVCC. 

### purpose
The purpose of this project was to use it as a way to reflect off of all the topics we learned in class. This major project was something we would continue to work on as we went by each lesson and continued to add more content in order to improve our website. 

### html
In the **<ins>header</ins>**, we learned how to use images properly on websites, as well as how to display them. The **<ins>biography</ins>** section highlights the usage of h1, h2, h3... as well as using the p tags in order to display text. As we move on to the **<ins>hobbies</ins>** section, it shows where we learned out to use lists. Just like the header, the **<ins>gallery</ins>** is also a representation of how we learned to insert images into a website, as well as adding a caption to the image. The **<ins>literature</ins>** section was a way to show a topic we would then later research for this project and share with the user our findings. After the literature section was a **<ins>video</ins>** where it would cover over a midterm project I did to reflect on what I had learned over the semester. Finally at the end of the Website was a **<ins>contact</ins>** page where if the users have any questions or would like to contact me, they can do so by filling out the form. 

### CSS
For the CSS portion of the project, we went over the design aspects for the website. This was a very crucial part of the project as it would affect the readibility and the engagement of the user for your website. Some things we learned when it came to styling in CSS was how padding and margins determined the spacing between the content on the webpage. Another thing we learned was how the layout would be affected depending on what screen the user was using. We learned to solve this problem by using media queries. 

### Color Scheme
When it came to choosing the color scheme for this project, I wanted to choose colors that represented me. I tried to choose colors that matched pretty well with each other, but also wouldn't affect the readibility of my website for those who have disabilities. 

For the **background color**, I mostly used ` #F0DB7F`, as it was the one that I thought wouldn't contracdict the most with the other colors, especially because it was the lightest shade I had choosen. For the **text / font color**, I wanted to go for a color that was more on the darker side, which is why I choose ` #755D22` as the main font color and ` #1C4D76`. And for certain sections of my website, I choose ` #D0CAEB` and ` #A4D2EB` to be the background colors in order to have it stick out on the website.
