            <h1> Biography: </h1>

             <div>
                <p>
                    I am a Computer Science major, currently attending RVCC. At the time this website is made, I am a second year student.
                    I took this class because I had some interest for web design, and also thought that it would be a fun elective to take to fill out my graduation requirements!
                    My first web design class started back in middle school, where we were taking all kinds of electives for half a marking period to showcase the highscool elextive classes.
                    I did fairly well in that class and even got along with the teacher that she was very supportive of my academics. She had reccomended me to take her highschool web design course 
                    in order to continue on my path with computer science. I feel that this is where my interest for coding began.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coming to Raritan Valley was not that much of an easy choice, espcially when it came to my family. Due to the beliefs of an Asian household, some family members had high expectations
                    of me attending a prestigious school while some wanted me to attending bigger technology colleges like NJIT or even Stevens. I had wanted to attending Raritan because it was very close
                    to where my hometown is and I would be able to save a lot of money. My decision came with a lot of thinking as it took me a lot of commitment and persuading to get to where I am now. 
                    Now, I am currently attending RVCC as an honors student!
                    My family does support me for all my decisions and I try not to let some of their opinions change my mind. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some facts about me are that I have two sisters, one older and one younger which makes me the middle child (sadly D:). My older sister has a small business making earrings, stickers,
                    etc. I help out by attending many events and also designing some stickers! Some of her popup events are mostly from different schools to anime conventions to even small market pop ups.
                    If you are interested in wanting to see these kinds of events, the business name is wingBunny and you can look on Instagram to catch up with any recent activity with this account! 
                    I also love to listen to music! For sure, J-Pop and K-Pop are my most listened to genres.

                        When I get the chance to, I play a LOT of games. There are many, consistening from RPG to indie, to even FPS games. Some notable names to mention are - Genshin Impact,

                        When I go out, you'll most likely find me at a pop store. Something about the concept with blind boxes has me in a hold... Collecting these kinds of figurines brings
                        me joy that I cannot really explain.

                       Cooking is super fun to me! When I do get the chance to cook something good, I always try to do it with a friend or one of my siblings. Most of my recipies are from
                       online because I don't really trust myself cooking without directions.

            <h2> Research on CSS Sprites</h2>

            <div> 
               <h3> <b> What are Sprites? </b> </h3>

               <p>
                 In Web Design, sprites are a collection of multiple images that are used compressed into one file. These images are then put into an blank canvas and positioned
                 by x and y coordinates. 
                 The reason they are compressed into one file is to optimize website performance. Depending on how large or little the traffic is on a website will affect the speed. 
                 Speed of a website can affect how fast the content of the page will load. 
               </p>

               <h3> <b> What causes websites to be slow? </b> </h3>

               <p>
                Lets take for example, carrying a backpack. When you add more items in your backpack, it becomes heavier, causing you to slow down due to the weight. But when you start to lower the ammount of
                weight you carry, you become faster. Just like a backpack, the more items you have on a website, the slower it will be. That's why the use of sprites and how they have the ability to compress 
                image files into one is super helpful in giving a speed boost to loading websites in. Not only does it reduce the number of files used, but it will also lower the ammount of storage
                the file takes.
               </p>

               <h3> <b> Why should sprites be used? </b> </h3>

               <p>
                Well, for one, we know that they can be used to optimize the speed of websites. Sprites reduce the number of HTTP requests that are used when loading websites by combining all the image files into
                one. If your website has a large gallery or just has a purpose to display images, sprites would be essential in order to reduce loading times. 
               </p>

               <h3> <b> How to create sprites? </b> </h3>

               <p> 
                You now might be wondering: how do we combine all these image files into one? We first have to create our image. Our image could be drawn by you or be used with proper copyright
                usage. Then in you CSS file, you should type do the following: 
               </p>
            
               <img src="IMG/css-sprite-example.png" alt="Sprite example from website">

               <p> 
                Follwoing this example, we can see that we first need to start off by deploying the image using "background-image" followed by the file link. We then follow by telling the program
                whether it should repeat or not. After doing so, we need to set the proper positions for each image in order to have them displayed properly on the website. 
              </p>

              <h3> <b> Other ways to use sprites </b> </h3>

              <p> 
                After learning about sprites, you might want to learn about more ways to have fun with them! https://www.w3schools.com/ has a lot of cool examples of how you can play with sprites.
                From this website, one of the awesome examples they have is creating a hover effect with sprites. For example, when you press the refresh button on your browser, it resets the 
                current website you're on. But, do you also realize that the refresh button is also just a sprite? Isn't that just cool!
